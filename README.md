A **100 % offline** browser application that lets you **upload any PDF**, index it locally, and **ask questions** answered **only** from that document using your local **Ollama** LLM.

## ⚠️ **Prerequisite – Download the LLM First**

Before you run the app, **pull the model** (only once):

```bash
ollama pull llama3        # default model used in this code
